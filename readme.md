## Mapping buildings with autonomous remote control cars - Description

The project main goal is to map buildings with the help of autonomous remote control cars, equipped with high resolution camera and ROS based computer.
This package deals with the AI module of the project, which upon receiving a 2D array, returns the best coordinate to travel to.

- Modular classes enable the implementations if various strategies of finding the most optimal coordinate.
- Flexible and adaptable implementation of the board.
 
## Motivation

This package is a part of software project directed by Ben Gurion University. The project combines both Software Engineering department and Electrical Engineering department.

As a part of many task forces daily routine, knowing the area surface can save lives.
